# Mole!
This is the code for my theme "Mole!". If you want to install an older version, the code and packages are here. The official page can be found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mole/ppabjmaplbgfpaclleoaciomjfnbilca.

## Download
Get whatever version that you want.

***Important Note: Do not click "Source code" unless you want to download every version! Downloading the other option gives you the source code anyway, since browser extensions are zipped, not compiled.***
